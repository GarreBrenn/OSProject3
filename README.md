# OS Project 3

Written by Garrett Brenner and Noah Guiltmier. Note: no makefile is included because Go does not require you to compile the code and execute it yourself. Refer to usage for instructions.


## Usage

```console
user@user:~/go run wordQueue.go [number of threads] < [stdin.txt]
```

If you omit the text file, you will be prompted to enter text yourself from your keyboard. When you have finished typing your message, hit Ctrl+D on Windows.
